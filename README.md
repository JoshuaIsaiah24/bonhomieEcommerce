The goal of this project is to showcase my skill in creating the backend layer of an E commerce website. This website has the following functions from:

-Products that are featured/on flash sale/newly added.
-Users can log in to their own account.
-Users can see their cart summary and can delete existing items on the cart.
-Users can search through categories.
-Users can make a payment through credit card and other payment methods.
-Users cart empties when ordering or can select which existing item on the cart to order.
-Users can track order and order check each items on the order.
-Users can leave reviews and comments for their feedback to the item ordered.
