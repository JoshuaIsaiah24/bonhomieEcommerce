# bonhomieEcommerce

The goal of this project is to showcase my skill in creating the backend layer of an E commerce website. This website has the following functions from:

1. Products that are featured/on flash sale/newly added.
2. Users can log in to their own account.
3. Users can see their cart summary and can delete existing items on the cart.
4. Users can search through categories.
5. Users can make a payment through credit card and other payment methods.
6. Users cart empties when ordering or can select which existing item on the cart to order.
7. Users can track order and order check each items on the order.
8. Users can leave reviews and comments for their feedback to the item ordered.
